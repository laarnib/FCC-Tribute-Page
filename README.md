# Build a Tribute Page

One of [Freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Projects] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/)  to apply the things I have learned in the HTML and CSS curriculum.

## Requirements
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

Fulfill the following user stories and get all of the tests to pass.
These user stories can also be found [here] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

    * ** User Story #1: ** My tribute page should have an element with the corresponding * id="main" * that contains all the other elements.
    * ** User Story #2: ** I should see an element with a corresponding * id="title" *, which contains a string that describes the subject of the tribute page.
    * ** User Story #3: ** I should see a * div * element with a corresponding * id="img-div" * .
    * ** User Story #4: ** Within the * img-div * element, I should see an *img* element with a corresponding *id="image".*
    * ** User Story #5: ** Within the * img-div * element, I should see an element with a corresponding * id="img-caption" * that contains textual content describing the image shown in * img-div *.
    * ** User Story #6: ** I should see an element with a corresponding * id="tribute-info" *, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
    * ** User Story #7: ** I should see an a element with a corresponding * id="tribute-link" *, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
