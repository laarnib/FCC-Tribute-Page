# Build a Tribute Page

One of [Freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/)  to apply the things I have learned in the HTML and CSS curriculum.

## Requirements
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

Fulfill the following user stories and get all of the tests to pass.
These user stories can also be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

    <li><strong>User Story #1:</strong> My tribute page should have an element with the corresponding <em>id="main"</em> that contains all the other elements.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #2:</strong> I should see an element with a corresponding <em>id="title"</em>, which contains a string that describes the subject of the tribute page.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #3:</strong> I should see a <em>div</em> element with a corresponding <em>id="img-div"</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #4:</strong> Within the <em>img-div</em> element, I should see an <em>img</em> element with a corresponding <em>id="image"</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #5:</strong> Within the <em>img-div</em> element, I should see an element with a corresponding <em>id="img-caption"</em> that contains textual content describing the image shown in <em>img-div</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #6:</strong> I should see an element with a corresponding <em>id="tribute-info"</em> , which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #7:</strong> I should see an a element with a corresponding <em>id="tribute-link"</em> , which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.</li>
    <li><strong>User Story #8:</strong> The <em>img</em> element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.</li>
